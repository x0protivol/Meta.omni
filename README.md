# Explaination of the project :   
An ultimate objective of our project is to create an infrastructure to achieve a decentralised fashion design ecosystem, where customers participate in design attributes voting process to influence the outcome of generative design fashion product. Once the voting process is complete a surprise generative design NFT is created that is distributed to the voters in a form of a 3D digital fashion product, that they can wear in metaverse, as well as an offline fashion item will be manufactured based on the surprise generative design and also distributed to the voters. As some minimum requirements are necessary to finalise voting process as well as an offline manufacturing process, it will be minted and produced in minimum required editions where the stock remainder of the NFTs and offline products that didnâ€™t sell during the voting process will be stored for the potential further sale on the market place. 

Potentially the design selection attributes can further decentralised by being feed directly from fashion trends agencies as well as contributing fashion brands individually or collaboratively can feed their brand identities into the voting process for future seasonal collections drops. Main objective is to offset basic product design from the centralised designer vision and let the public influence the final design outcome of the product, hence creating a decentralised fashion line while simultaneously pre-selling the offline product too. Buyers/voters can be given hint from the start which trend or design direction to expect from each product (whether it is military, skater, girly, floral, futuristic trends etc) but definitive design will be influenced by majority voting and eventually ai contribution. Blockchain and NFTs and voting will allow the design to never repeat in attributes and final results from drop to drop despite being given similar attributes, trends or using basic repetitive shapes. 

In this pilot version we are focusing on a proof of concept for the voting system and smart contract behind it, by using the designs of our in-house brand (KOMETA.A Ladybug / META.A KOMETA.A) and further on we intend to continue developing it to achieve the ultimate goal of decentralising fashion design ecosystem for other brands too. As Lukso is fashion oriented blockchain, we intend to continue building our platform with Lukso in mind further on.
